<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Installing</h1>

In the build directory, there are a collection of scripts to be used to
install and uninstall the MDS and various modules.  If run with no
parameter (e.g.  "install_nt4"), they will (un)install the release
version.  You may also provide a parameter (e.g.  "install_nt4 debug")
to specify another version to (un)install.  Those batch files with
"_apps" in the name (un)install only the MDS and the framework, while
the others install the MDS, the framework, and the two BSPs (password
and dummy).

<p>The mds_install application has the following usage:

<pre>Usage: mds_install [-u] -s file [-d path]
  -u            Uninstall the module.
  -s file       Source file to install; no extension if installing, file name
                        only when uninstalling or refreshing
  -d path       Destination path; required for install.
</pre>

<p>The mod_install application has the following usage:

<pre>Usage: mod_install [-fiur] -s file [-d path]
  -f            Unused option reserved for future use.
  -i            Install the module.
  -u            Uninstall the module.
  -r            Refresh the installation information.
                        ** Options -i, -u, and -r are mutually exclusive. **
  -s file       Source file to install; no extension if installing, file name
                        only when uninstalling or refreshing
  -d path       Destination path; required for install.
</pre>

<p>The source files must include a path to the DLL to install, if it is not
in the current directory.  The destination of MDS must be in the search
path, typically the system directory (e.g.  C:\Windows\System\ or
C:\Winnt\System32\).  The destination of the framework (bioapi100.dll)
must currently be in the search path, although this is expected to
change before the 1.1 release.  The destination of a BSP may be
anywhere; MDS remembers where, and the framework uses this to locate and
load the BSP at runtime.

<p>See the contents of the batch files for examples of how to use these in
practice.
